# Kubernetes Workshops

This repository contains both complete workshops, as well as
segmented workshop modules that can be combined to create Kubernetes
workshops of various lengths and focus.

Modules contain a README.md that walks through the module. If code,
configuration, or scrips are needed, it is included and tested.

This is not an official Google product.
